			<strong>When I was a kid</strong>, there’s a lot of things that I got interested on.<sup><i>1</i></sup>
			I was less than 5 years old, I remember joining onto my siblings doing their homework.<sup><i>2</i></sup>
			At that age, I already learned how to write in cursive.<sup><i>3</i></sup>
			I would say that I got a wonderful childhood, since I spend a lot of my times doing what I love.<sup><i>4</i></sup>
			I am an average student in my elementary years, I didn’t study hard because I like to play <em>outdoor games</em>, <em>basketball</em>, 
			and <em>video games (the one that is rentable)</em>, and I also like to <em>draw</em>.<sup><i>5</i></sup>
			Even though, I didn’t focus on studying I always on the top five students in the class from grade one to six.<sup><i>6</i></sup>
			I also became a top one student when I was in third grade 
			because my uncle promised me that he would buy me a PSP when I become a top student.<sup><i>7</i></sup>
			But it didn’t happen because PSP is so expensive that time.<sup><i>8</i></sup></p>
			<a href="../../child/3.jpg" target="pictab"><img src="../../child/3.jpg" alt="This is an image of me during my elementary graduation"
			title="This is an image of me during my elementary graduation" class="childpic3" /></a>
			<p>All those years, I only study for quarterly examination, and I always got high scores, especially in math.<sup><i>9</i></sup>
			<strong>I really love math</strong>, I like solving <dfn>mathematical problems</dfn>, <dfn>puzzles</dfn>, etc.<sup><i>10</i></sup>
			That’s why my first dream was to be a <strong>civil engineer</strong> someday.<sup><i>11</i></sup>
			During my last year in elementary, my mother decided to go abroad to provide 
			our financial needs since my sister is going to college.<sup><i>12</i></sup>
			At that time, I don’t fully understand the situation. I’m sad but at the same time, I’m also happy because as a 
			kid I thought that I would get what I want since my mother is an OFW.<sup><i>13</i></sup>
			After I graduated elementary, I enrolled to high school and took an exam for a special science section and got accepted.<sup><i>14</i></sup></p>
			<p>During my first year in high school, I kind of neglected studying since being a special science student is hard.<sup><i>15</i></sup>
			I’m only 12 years old that time and my scheduled was 7 am to 5 pm.<sup><i>16</i></sup>
			There are only 2 subjects that I’m interested in, first is <strong><i>math</i></strong>,
			and second is a <strong><i>computer subject</i></strong> which is about <dfn>designing text</dfn>, and <dfn>html</dfn>.<sup><i>17</i></sup>
			The next year, <b><em>html</em></b>, <b><em>photoshop</em></b>, and <b><em>video editing</em></b> became our subject.<sup><i>18</i></sup>
			At that time, I don’t fully understand html, that’s why I struggled on that subject but 
			I enjoy coding, editing photos, and I like the computer laboratory environment.<sup><i>19</i></sup>
			Since then, I considered becoming <strong>professional on computer related jobs</strong> as my dream.<sup><i>20</i></sup>

			<strong>In my teenage years</strong>,there’s nothing new, but I somehow become matured.<sup><i>1</i></sup>
			What maturity I’m talking about is about understanding <strong>what life really is</strong>.<sup><i>2</i></sup>
			<b><em>I’m confuse</em></b>, I don’t know what is really I want, what exactly I wanted to become. <sup><i>3</i></sup>
			At that time, there’s a lot of things that I really love especially <em>playing basketball</em>, 
			I’m addicted to it, and <em>I love to draw (traditional and digital)</em>.<sup><i>4</i></sup>
			I’m also interested in <em>photo and video editing</em>, although it is just a hobby but 
			I really <strong>love</strong> doing all those things.<sup><i>5</i></sup>
			I remember doing nonsense photo and video editing stuffs with my friends, 
			we are always laughing together while watching it.<sup><i>6</i></sup></p>

			title="This is an image of me when I was in 10th grade."/></a>
			<p>I still didn’t change that time, I’m still not focusing on my studies.<sup><i>7</i></sup>
			I remember when it is second to the last year of my junior high school.<sup><i>8</i></sup>
			I did bad things as a student, because I want <strong><i>to be removed from being a special science section</i></strong>.<sup><i>9</i></sup>
			So, I often <dfn>cut class</dfn>, especially science class because during that time, we have 3 science subjects, 
			and <strong>I don’t like science</strong>.<sup><i>10</i></sup>
			<a href="../../teen/7.jpg" target="pictab"><img src="../../teen/7.jpg" alt="This is an image of me when I was on 11th grade" class="teenpic4"
			title="This is an image of me when I was on 11th grade"/></a>
			Because of that, I became section 5 in my last year in junior high, <strong>I’m very happy</strong> because of that, 
			but my parents, especially my mother is a little bit <strong><em>disappointed</em></strong>.<sup><i>11</i></sup>
			At that time, I somehow became <strong>focus</strong> on studying, I became <strong>active</strong> and 
			I remember winning a <strong><em>poem contest</em></strong> on the celebration of teacher’s day.<sup><i>12</i></sup>
			Sounds different right? I forgot to tell you that I also have a skill in <strong>writing poems</strong>, 
			I love writing phrases with <em>rhymes</em>.<sup><i>13</i></sup>
			But again, it is just my hobby, and I don’t think that I will pursue that profession.<sup><i>15</i></sup></p>
			<p>After I graduated in junior high school, my first choice is to study in <strong>PUP</strong> and I want to take an <strong><em>ICT strand</em></strong>, 
			but since I didn’t study well, my <b>GWA</b> didn’t reach their requirements.<sup><i>16</i></sup>
			Then, I find another school, my one friend invited me to apply in <strong>UM</strong>, the other one invited me in UE to take an exam.<sup><i>17</i></sup>
			I passed the <strong>UE</strong> entrance exam, later on, I chose to enroll in UE because there’s a lot of 
			people saying that computer courses are good in this university.<sup><i>18</i></sup>
			My parents agreed on me since my school fees are expensive, <strong><em>I promise to my self</em></strong> that I will study hard in that senior high years and 
			I won’t let the money that is from the hard work of my mother go to waste.<sup><i>19</i></sup>
			In those two years of senior high school, I would say that I had found the profession that 
			I really want which is to become a <strong>programmer</strong>.<sup><i>20</i></sup>
			I graduated in senior high school as honored student and became a <strong><i>full scholar</i></strong> in CHED, it helps a lot so I can be able to 
			continue my studies in <strong>UE</strong>.<sup><i>21</i></sup>

			<strong>In my first year of college</strong>, I took BSIT course. 
			It was not that hard, since we already learned the basic programming in our senior high school years.<sup><i>1</i></sup>
			But I feel different since it was a <em>new environment</em> for me as freshman, and the fact 
			that the tuition is more expensive than in senior high.<sup><i>2</i></sup>
			<strong>I feel pressure</strong> knowing that I need to maintain my grades for <strong><em>CHED scholarship</em></strong>.<sup><i>3</i></sup>
			My first semester is good, I had a good grade, and surprisingly, became qualified on <strong><em>COLLEGE scholarship</em></strong>.<sup><i>4</i></sup>
			Because of that, my tuition 50% discounted and my CHED scholarship fill the other 50%.<sup><i>5</i></sup>
			That day, I learned that they offer better scholarships than I achieved so, I study hard,
			and at the of the second semester, I become <strong><em>University Scholar</em></strong>.<sup><i>6</i></sup>
			Up until now, I’m still qualified for University scholarship, it was my third semester to be qualified on it.<sup><i>7</i></sup></p>
			<p>Going back before the COVID-19 cases arise, I told my mother to come home, since I don’t pay tuition fees, 
			and my siblings are already graduated.<sup><i>8</i></sup>
			I told her that <b><em>she should go back home</em></b>, <dfn>for her to rest</dfn>,
			and I will maintain my grades in order to not pay for school fees.<sup><i>9</i></sup>
			It is almost 9 years since she left us to work abroad, throughout those years, <dfn>she was alone</dfn>, 
			<dfn>she sacrifices herself</dfn> for us to have a better life.<sup><i>10</i></sup>
			But because of pandemic and she also had a serious problem in her bladder, <strong>she was forced to go home</strong>.<sup><i>11</i></sup>
			She needs <dfn>proper medication</dfn>, and a <dfn>frequently consultation to the hospital</dfn>.<sup><i>12</i></sup>
			Since my mother and also my auntie needs a proper medication, and <strong>my mother doesn’t have a work</strong>, 
			my father is often selling foods enough our daily expenses.<sup><i>13</i></sup></p>
			<a href="../../college/5.jpeg" target="pictab"><img src="../../college/5.jpeg" alt="This is an image of my family." class="collegepic4"
			title="This is an image of my family."/></a>
			<div align="justify">
			<p>It is <strong>very hard</strong> for me as a student as it <strong><em>doubled the pressure</em></strong> I am experiencing.<sup><i>15</i></sup>
			I don’t have a choice but to study very hard, maintaining the required grades. <sup><i>16</i></sup>
			At this point, If I fail to become qualify in scholarship there is a possibility that I will stop studying, 
			since we have no other source of income.<sup><i>17</i></sup>
			And also, if stop studying CHED will definitely stop giving assistance to me.<sup><i>18</i></sup>
			But I must not be afraid, all I need to do is be strong in this situation, I’m always determine, motivated and inspired. <sup><i>19</i></sup>
			Because I believe in what <cite><strong>Kobe Bryant</strong></cite> said <q><b>If you’re afraid to fail, then you’re 
			probably going to fail.</q>.</b><sup><i>20</i></sup>
